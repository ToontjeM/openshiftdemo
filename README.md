# EDB Postgres for Kubernetes on OpenShift Local
In this demo I'll show you how to create a PostgreSQL cluster with the Red Hat OpenShift operator called EDB Postgres for Kubernetes. The features that I want to show you are:
- Kubernetes plugin install
- EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator install
- Postgres cluster install
- Insert data in the cluster
- Switchover (promote)
- Failover
- Backup & Recovery (in a S3 Minio platform)
- Scale out/down
- Rolling updates (minor and major)
- Point In Time Recovery (PITR)
- Fencing
- Replication slots (for HA)
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Operator upgrade
- Last EDB Postgres for Kubernetes tested version is 1.20.2

## Demo prep
- Install RedHat OpenShift Local from [https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview)
- Make sure you have your pull secret downloaded. Instructions on how to get the pull secret [here](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local).
- Run `crc setup` to prepare OpenShift Local. This will take a while since it needs to download the crc bundle which is over 4,5GB and the ReHat network is not always very performant, then decompress it into a 31GB VM image.
```
Your system is correctly setup for using CRC. Use 'crc start' to start the instance
[elapsed 49m13s (CPU 16.1%)] crc setup
```
- Run `crc start` to create your OpenShift Local cluster. This will take a few minutes as well.
```
Started the OpenShift cluster.

The server is accessible via web console at:
  https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing

Log in as administrator:
  Username: kubeadmin
  Password: automagicallygenerated

Log in as user:
  Username: developer
  Password: developer

Use the 'oc' command line interface:
  $ eval $(crc oc-env)
  $ oc login -u kubeadmin https://api.crc.testing:6443 (Developer doesn't have permissions to deploy the operator)
```
- Run `eval $(crc oc-env)` and `oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443`
- Create a new project called `demo` using `oc new-project demo`
```
-main- âœ— ~/openshiftdemo oc new-project demo
Now using project "demo" on server "https://api.crc.testing:6443".
```

## Demo flow
- Install the cnpg plug-in for kubectl using `./01_install_plugin.sh`
./02_install_operator.sh
./03_check_operator_installed.sh
./05_install_cluster.sh
or
./05_install_cluster_tde.sh
```
Open a new session and execute:
```
./06_show_status.sh
```
Go back to the previous session and execute:
```
./07_insert_data.sh
./08_promote.sh
./09_upgrade.sh
./10_backup_cluster.sh
./11_backup_describe.sh
./12_restore_cluster.sh
./13_failover.sh
./14_scale_out.sh
./15_scale_down.sh

# PITR
./16_pitr_insert_two_lines.sh
./17_pitr_backup.sh
./18_pitr_insert_new_line.sh
./19_pitr_restore_line_one.sh
```
# Major upgrade
Major upgrade feature has been introduced in 1.16 version.
In this demo I show you how to upgrade your cluster from PosgreSQL v13 to v14.
```
./20_create_cluster_v13.sh
./21_insert_data_cluster_v13.sh
./22_verify_data_inserted.sh
./23_upgrade_v13_to_v14.sh
./24_verify_data_migrated.sh
```
Or upgrade your current cluster:
```
./25_upgrade_cluster_to_15.sh
```

# Fencing and Hibernation
```
./30_fencing_on.sh
./31_fencing_off.sh
./32_hibernation_on.sh
./33_hibernation_off.sh
```
# Operator management
```
```
# Deploy pgBouncer (pooling)
```
./60_pgbouncer.sh
```

# Delete clusters
```
./delete_all_clusters.sh
```

# Deploy Prometheus/Grafana monitoring tools
```
cd monitoring
./01_install_prometheus_repo.sh
./02_prometheus_operator.sh
./03_prometheus_rules.sh
./04_grafana_dashboard.sh
./05_port_forwarding_prometheus_grafana.sh

./99_remove_monitoring.sh
```

- To connect to Grafana dashboard: http://localhost:3000
  - **User:** admin
  - **Password:** prom-operator

- To connect to Prometheus dashboard: http://localhost:9090

# Deploy Minio
```
cd minio
./install_minio.sh

./uninstall_minio.sh
```

# Red Hat Code Ready commands
Console:
```
The server is accessible via web console at:
  https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing
```

Here some Open Shift Code Ready commands:
```
#Use the 'oc' command line interface:
eval $(crc oc-env)
oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443

# Clean environment
crc delete -f
crc cleanup

# Setup environment
crc setup
crc config set cpus 12
crc config set consent-telemetry no
crc config set memory 16384
crc config set preset openshift

# Start crc
crc start

# Connect to OpenShift platform as admin
oc login -u kubeadmin https://api.crc.testing:6443
```
